# Welcome to Komak‚Äôs open-source repository üôè

## What is Komak?

Komak is an app born out of necessity in the wake of the COVID-19 events. There are people in our community more susceptible or already exposed to the effects of the virus than others. The goal of Komak is to provide a digital platform for healthy volunteers to help out those most in need. 

Komak uses geolocation services to send requests for help with groceries, for example, to nearby volunteers that are willing to help out.

Komak is meant to be open-source, as we need all of the help we can get in this hopefully short-lived endeavor.
